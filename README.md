<b>Problem statement:</b> Lots of  accidents  at worksites(construction, oil rig, seaports) have usually been as a result of equipment failure.
<br> 
In times past, equipments have mostly failed due to human error.
<br>
One of the instances of human error has been a case of some workers being struck by moving parts of  heavy equipments, loads or containers because the workers weren't in the line of sight of the heavy equipment operators.
<br>
In as much as someone such as  a banksman  could  give hand and arm signal to a crane operator for instance, the same banksman could be in danger if he's giving signals with his hands from a blindspot(an area out of the operator's sight).
<br>
<b>How does AI solve the problem?</b>
<br>
With machine learning and computer vision technologies,  drones and maybe other types of UAVs can relay hand signals from areas of poor visibility to operators of heavy duty equipment at worksites( oil rig, construction sites, seaports e.t.c) 
<br>
So we would use DroneAid's open source repo as an inspiration to create a model for drones to detect/recognize/interpret and relay maybe 4 0r 5 basic hand and arm signals to operators in order to minimize accidents at worksites.
